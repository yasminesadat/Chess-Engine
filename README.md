# Chess-Engine
This project implements part of the chess engine to visualize and move pieces using Haskel.

Haskel's higher order functions play a key rule in checking legal moves on the chess board.


To keep things simple, the project assumes the following:

a) There are no promotions of pawns.

b) It is legal for a king to move to locations in which he will be threatened.
